A mature AI system is less about a single model and more about the control layer around model execution.

## Core design logic

1. Route tasks by sensitivity, latency, and economics.
2. Enforce role-based access at the request layer.
3. Meter usage per team and workflow.
4. Track output lineage for auditability.

## Strategic impact

When the control plane is explicit, AI usage becomes operable at enterprise scale instead of isolated experimentation.

This site is running on Astro, articles using MDX. Just trying out some tech stacks.

**Note**: The source for this site was built for my own portfolio and client work showcase, not as a starter template or theme. Feel free to take inspiration from structure and design ideas, but this codebase is not maintained as a clone-and-deploy product. For your own production blog or portfolio, use a dedicated starter template that matches your stack and workflow.
